# [BETA BRANCH] Not yet on the main branch.
# WD66 ver 0.1
# Terraria inspired keyboard.
# As of 11/27/2022 PCB is finished, but not yet tested.
# Witch Doctor 66 is a 65% mechanical keyboard, with layout similar to Leopold FC660M. The idea is to make it compatible with Leopold's case if you don't solder in 2 switches. I want this project to live beyond group buy (if it will ever happen), hence secondary function of PCB to be a drop-in replacement into Leopold. You can find pictures of implemented layouts and layouts planed below, as well as pictures of the PCB.

# As mentioned above it is not yet tested, since I don't have money for prototyping right now. You are welcome to fork, modify and produce it on your own, that said I would like to be in the know about production for profit (dm me on discord: gan1a#5261); also don't be an a*s, don't erase solder mask art))). Rough to-do list is below.
