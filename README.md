# WD66 ver 0.1


# As of 12/21/2023 PCB is finished, and tested.

# Witch Doctor 66 is a 65% mechanical keyboard, with layout similar to Leopold FC660M. The idea is to make it compatible with Leopold's case if you don't solder in 2 switches. I want this project to live beyond group buy (if it will ever happen), hence secondary function of PCB to be a drop-in replacement into Leopold. You can find pictures of implemented layouts and layouts planed below, as well as pictures of the PCB.

# You are welcome to fork, modify and produce it on your own, that said I would like to be in the know about production for profit (dm me on discord: gan1a#5261); also don't be an a*s, don't erase solder mask art))). Rough to-do list is below.

# For ongoing development and planed features please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/gan11a/WD66/issues) page of WD66 Repository.

# Huge thanks to my friends FOXY and ANV3R for supporting me through this project.
