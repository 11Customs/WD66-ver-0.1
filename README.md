# WD66 ver 0.1


# As of 12/21/2023 PCB is finished, and tested.

# Witch Doctor 66 is a 65% mechanical keyboard, with layout similar to Leopold FC660M. The idea is to make it compatible with Leopold's case if you don't solder in 2 switches. I want this project to live beyond group buy (if it will ever happen), hence secondary function of PCB to be a drop-in replacement into Leopold. You can find pictures of implemented layouts and layouts planed below, as well as pictures of the PCB.

# You are welcome to fork, modify and produce it on your own, that said I would like to be in the know about production for profit (dm me on discord: gan1a#5261); also don't be an a*s, don't erase solder mask art))). Rough to-do list is below.

<h2>
<ul>
  <s><li>Peer review</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Add layout options + maybe rotate the diodes</li>
  <li>Misc changes from peer review (Ver 0.2)</li></s>
  </ul>
  <li>Prototyping; 1st round (Only PCB)</li>
  <ul>
  <s><li>Logic and basic stuff checks</li>
  <li>Fit check with fc660m case</li></s>
  <li>Sending out first protos to ppl who wanted them</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Modifications before official runs</li>
  <ul>
  <li>USB port for Leopold case rework, possibly different daughterboard implementation</li>
  <li>Plate and case development and prototyping</li>
  <li>First IC</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
